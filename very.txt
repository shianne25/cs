When you like me very very very
Very very very very very very
Very very very very very very
Very much, then tell me
When you keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep thinking of me, then call me
People say guys are all the same
Do not to believe them when they say I love you
Because even before they really love
They just say the words
I’ve never felt this way before
I’ve never been this way to anyone else
Even if they say this while looking into my eyes
People tell me not to fall for it

Oh no, I have to be careful
(I’m sorry babe) Can’t forget the words
From my mom or my friends
Oh no, I’m sorry but
I can’t trust in your heart
And open my own

When you like me very very very
Very very very very very very
Very very very very very very
Very much, then tell me
When you keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep thinking of me, then call me

Stop, Like a flipped over pillow
You have a new feel
But I need to hold it in
You need to go through a long process of checking
So I can find out whether you’re the snake or Adam
People told me that men are all wolves
Why have men treated women like that?
Is it because so many women
Have committed the sin of making you cry?
Will you show me your heart a little more?

Oh no, I have to be careful
(I’m sorry babe) No matter how much
Your eyes and your words shake my heart
Oh no, I’m sorry but
Your heart that is for me
Can’t you show me a little more?

When you like me very very very
Very very very very very very
Very very very very very very
Very much, then tell me
When you keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep thinking of me, then call me

I hope you understand
Even if it makes you upset or frustrated
I hope you’ll wait for me a little more
After my heart opens
All of my feelings that I saved up
I will give to you without holding back

When you like me very very very
Very very very very very very
Very very very very very very
Very much, then tell me
When you keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep thinking of me, then call me

Very very very very very very
Very very very very very
Keep keep keep keep keep keep
Keep keep keep keep
