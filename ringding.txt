Babe, I’ve fallen, so why treat me like this?
Don’t run away in fear
But why not try trusting me, my lady
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding

Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding

Butterfly, from the moment I met you
My eyes flashed, stop
And a bell in my head rang ding dong
Look, I may not be attractive, nice
Or anything like that
But I’m a decent bad boy

You’re like a butterfly
So weak, I’ve fallen
So gentle, I’ve fallen
I have to have you near me
Don’t worry any more, any more
You only have to trust me
I’m really digging you
I can’t let you go

Babe, you stop my breath, oh crazy
So pretty I can’t stand it, oh crazy
I don’t need anything else, crazy
Why am I like this?

We wanna go rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rock
(So fantastic)
Go rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rock
(So elastic)

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic
Elastic, elastic, elastic, elastic

Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(I can hear it)
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(It’s ringing in my head)

Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(My heart is calling)
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding

I called you butterfly
As the days go by
The idea that I can’t escape you
Gets driven in further, girl

Choose me (Don’t turn away)
Choose me (Don’t run away)
You have to take responsibility
For this fool that’s fallen for you

Babe, you stop my breath, oh crazy
So pretty I can’t stand it, oh crazy
I don’t need anything else, crazy
Why am I like this?

I don’t understand how you
Caught the kindness syndrome
It’s okay if you sometimes
Break away from that stereotyped image

Break out (hey) break out (hey)
Break out (hey) break out (hey)
Ring ding ding ding ding di di di di di di di di
Dong dong dong dong dodo dong dodo dong

Honestly I’m nervous as to how you see me
You might, you just might have
A good impression of me
I can’t help but be on pins and needles
I can’t turn away

Complicate girl
(Please don’t respond with a no)
I’m an pretty cool guy
(But I might go crazy)

Don’t be silly girl (Silly girl)
You’re my miracle (My miracle)
If I could only have you
I don’t need anything else

Babe, you stop my breath, oh crazy
So pretty I can’t stand it, oh crazy
I don’t need anything else, crazy
Why am I like this?

We wanna go rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rock
(So fantastic)
Go rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rocka, rock
(So elastic)

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic
Elastic, elastic, elastic, elastic

Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(I can hear it)
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(It’s ringing in my head)

Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
(My heart is calling)
Ring ding dong, ring ding dong
Ring diggy ding diggy ding ding ding
