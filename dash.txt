Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, um ah, run it

You can call me reckless (zig zag)
Fearlessly thrown road map (zig zag)
Blocking my way, barricade
Softly tread over it (We ride, we ride)

Blinking red light in the dark
Perhaps it’s warning me to stop
But I don’t wanna stop it
Hesitation, crash it

Shaking stars and I run
Into the distance, rough road
Step into paths I’ve never been to

Raise it up to the infinity
Wherever I step on become runway
Towards opposite of what the world wants we ride
We go zero to a hunnid

I wanna dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, um ah, run it
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash

Woo Speed up to the max
Woo My heart’s beating fast
Woo the way I’ve dreamed
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it

NMIXX!

Keeping my side always empty
Anybody who wants it, just hop in
Leave your trace with skid mark
Anything that blocks us, we bump

Raise it up to the infinity
Wherever I step on become runway
Let’s begin Revolution for evolution
We go zero to a hunnid

I wanna dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it

Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, um ah, run it
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash

One more time, breathe
Never stop, never stop, never stop
Racing heart’s a danger

But take it to the max
Hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight
Don’t be scared, come in

NMIXX, change up!

Into the distance
Unfolds our days
Yeah we get it, we face it
Take the helm of our journey

Fire a flare up to the sky, bang
Just follow the beats of your heart
Don’t stop, don’t hesitate, No matter
Um, I just wanna continue my pace

Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
Dash, um ah, run it
I wanna run some more
(Yeah, make a dash, hey!)
I wanna run it, run it

Dash, I wanna dash
I wanna run it, run it
